# Welcome to my Design collection :stars:
This repo stores (some of) my artworks, including 
- **IG posts** - mostly from my club's social media when I was the pubs
    - if interested, check out @sp_aikido_club, where I also posted some reels which were filmed and edited by me
- **Digital designs** (eg., shirt design, club banner) 
- **Hand sketches**, I did most drawings with pen and paper but I'm slowly switching to digital

## Tools :wrench:
- :fireworks: Digital designs: Canva, exploring Figma
- :runner: Video editor: Capcut
- :camera: Photo: Hypic/é†’å›¾
- :pencil2: Drawing: pen & paper -> Krita
